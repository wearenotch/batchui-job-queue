For detailed instruction on how to use this libarary please see main **batch-ui** docs. 

To use this library in SpringBoot JPA configured application you need to:
 1) Add **batchui-job-queue-${version}.jar** to your project
 2) Add annotation **@EnableDbQueueProcessing** to you main Spring Boot class
 3) Add modified @EntityScan annotation to include your domain package(s) and batchui domain package (as displayed in the snippet bellow) 
 4) Possibly configuring it in application.properties or application.yml to better suit your needs.

```Java
@SpringBootApplication
@EntityScan({"yourapp.domain.package", "com.ag04.batchui.dbqueue.domain"})
@EnableDbQueueProcessing
public class YourApp {
...
}
```

### Configuration

Library can be customized by configuring the following variables in the appropriate spring application.yml or application.properties file.

```
batchui.dbqueue.enable=true # this does not need to be defined, true is default value
batchui.dbqueue.consumer.polling-interval=30 # poll interval in seconds
batchui.dbqueue.consumer.polling-items-limit=100
 ```

(*) Core of this library is jpa queue mechanism described by Vjeran Marčinko in the following articles:
- [Part 1: Practical queueing using SQL - Rationale and general design](https://medium.com/agency04/practical-queueing-using-sql-part-1-rationale-and-general-design-d180d6848030)
- [Part 2: Practical queueing using SQL - Do it simply using Spring Boot and JPA](https://medium.com/agency04/practical-queueing-using-sql-part-2-do-it-simply-using-spring-boot-and-jpa-e9cb53f91f36)

For the simplicity of the use of this jar, classes from the article are reproduced here, so that client app need to import only this jar.
